# Gnosis API

Public Gnosis RPC provides most reliable access via API to anybody.
Copy endpoint link and enjoy it:
https://rpc.ap-southeast-1.gateway.fm/v4/gnosis/non-archival/mainnet

If you use public RPC you don't need authorization Bearer token,
it means that this header should be deleted from your request:

-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_API_KEY>"
