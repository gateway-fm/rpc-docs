# eth\_getLogs

### Parameters

`Object` - The filter options:

* `fromBlock`: `QUANTITY|TAG` - (optional, default: "latest") Value:
  * Integer block number
  * "latest" for the last mined block
  * "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined transactions.
* `toBlock`: `QUANTITY|TAG` - (optional, default: "latest") Value:
  * Integer block number
  * "latest" for the last mined block
  * "pending", "earliest" for not yet mined transactions.
* `address`: `DATA|Array`, 20 Bytes - (optional) Contract address or a list of addresses from which logs should originate.
* `topics`: `Array` of `DATA`, - (optional) Array of 32 Bytes DATA topics.&#x20;
  * Topics are order-dependent. Each topic can also be an array of DATA with "or" options.&#x20;
  * Check out more details on how to format topics in [eth\_newFilter](./#eth\_newfilter).
* `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - (optional) With the addition of EIP-234 (Geth >= v1.8.13 or Parity >= v2.1.0), blockHash is a new filter option which restricts the logs returned to the single block with the 32-byte hash blockHash. Using blockHash is equivalent to fromBlock = toBlock = the block number with hash `blockHash`. **If blockHash is present in the filter criteria, then neither `fromBlock` nor `toBlock` are allowed.**


### Returns

`Array` - Array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll.

* For filters created with `eth_newBlockFilter` the return are block hashes (`DATA`, 32 Bytes), e.g. `["0x3454645634534..."]`.
* For filters created with `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`  the return are transaction hashes (`DATA`, 32 Bytes), e.g. `["0x6345343454645..."]`.
* For filters created with `eth_newFilter` logs are objects with following params:
  * `removed`: `TAG` - `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if its a valid log.
  * `logIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the log index position in the block. `null` when its pending log.
  * `transactionIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the transactions index position log was created from. `null` when its pending log.
  * `transactionHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was created from. `null` when its pending log.
  * `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.
  * `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY` - the block number where this log was in. `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.
  * `address`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
  * `data`: `DATA` - contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics`: `Array of DATA` - Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes `DATA` of indexed log arguments.&#x20;
    * In _solidity_: The first topic is the _hash_ of the signature of the event (e.g. `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`), except you declare the event with the `anonymous` specifier.
