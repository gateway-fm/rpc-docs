  Polling method for a filter, which returns an array of logs which occurred
  since last poll.

# eth\_getFilterChanges

### Parameters

`QUANTITY` - the filter id.


### **Returns**

`Array` - Array of log objects, or an empty array if nothing has changed since last poll.

**NOTE: **`eth_getFilterChanges` only returns logs since the filter was **created**, regardless of the block passed in to create the filter. To get logs ranging from a specific block you should use [`eth_getLogs`](eth\_getlogs.md)` .`


* For filters created with `eth_newBlockFilter` the return are block hashes (`DATA`, 32 Bytes), e.g. `["0x3454645634534..."]`.
* For filters created with `eth_newPendingTransactionFilter`  the return are transaction hashes (`DATA`, 32 Bytes), e.g. `["0x6345343454645..."]`.
* For filters created with `eth_newFilter` logs are objects with following params:
  * `removed`: `TAG` - `true` when the log was removed, due to a chain reorganization. `false` if its a valid log.
  * `logIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the log index position in the block. `null` when its pending log.
  * `transactionIndex`: `QUANTITY` - integer of the transactions index position log was created from. `null` when its pending log.
  * `transactionHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the transactions this log was created from. `null` when its pending log.
  * `blockHash`: `DATA`, 32 Bytes - hash of the block where this log was in. `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.
  * `blockNumber`: `QUANTITY` - the block number where this log was in. `null` when its pending. `null` when its pending log.
  * `address`: `DATA`, 20 Bytes - address from which this log originated.
  * `data`: `DATA` - contains one or more 32 Bytes non-indexed arguments of the log.
  * `topics`: `Array of DATA` - Array of 0 to 4 32 Bytes `DATA` of indexed log arguments.&#x20;
    * In _solidity_: The first topic is the _hash_ of the signature of the event (e.g. `Deposit(address,bytes32,uint256)`), except you declare the event with the `anonymous` specifier.
